                Since my Lynch-a-thon last month, I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about my approach to logic and film: as I over-intellectualize everything in my life, so too have I done so in engaging movies. <br><br>
                Today, as I listen to two of my favorite critics discuss their Severance theories, I wonder: am I finally moving beyond TV theorizing as a practice? <br><br>
                To me, Severance is so engaging beat-to-beat that I have placed all my trust in its creators; I trust that they‚Äôll provide their own answers in the way they mean to down the line, and I‚Äôm willing to take whatever ride to get there. To try to watch every scene with a particular theory in mind would be to try to judge that theory in every moment over the show, potentially robbing myself of the emotional reactions the well-crafted show was designed to deliver. <br><br>
                Do I understand something logically or emotionally? How do I approach my media, and is that the most fulfilling approach?

                Continuing my ‚Äúbuild for me and only for me‚Äù phase with the new short-form section on the website.<br><br>
                The longer we are from 2007, the more we can see how Twitter fundamentally shifted things, for good and for worse. 
                I still miss it, but to participate nowadays feels largely performative. <br><br>
                Here, I can jot down some thoughts and maybe a single person might come across it, but if not? Who cares. <br><br>
                It‚Äôs a freeing sort of mentality.

                <p>In trying to make my ‚Äúcareer‚Äù posts a bit more lively and to add some fun breaks to my ‚Äúresume‚Äù page, I thought I would include some pictures where I can of my different gigs over the years.
